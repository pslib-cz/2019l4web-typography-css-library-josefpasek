            <h2>So what is this minimalism thing?</h2>
            <p>It’s quite simple: to be a minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own a car or a
                home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over
                the world, you must start a blog, you can’t have children, and you must be a young white male from a
                privileged background.</p>
            <p>OK, we’re joking—obviously. But people who dismiss minimalism as some sort of fad usually mention any of
                the above “restrictions” as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t about any of
                those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If you desire to live with fewer material
                possessions, or not own a car or a television, or travel all over the world, then minimalism can lend a
                hand. But that’s not the point.</p>
            <p>Minimalism is a tool that can assist you in finding freedom. Freedom from fear. Freedom from worry.
                Freedom from overwhelm. Freedom from guilt. Freedom from depression. Freedom from the trappings of the
                consumer culture we’ve built our lives around. Real freedom.</p>

            <p>That doesn’t mean there’s anything inherently wrong with owning material possessions. Today’s problem
                seems to be the meaning we assign to our stuff: we tend to give too much meaning to our things, often
                forsaking our health, our relationships, our passions, our personal growth, and our desire to contribute
                beyond ourselves. Want to own a car or a house? Great, have at it! Want to raise a family and have a
                career? If these things are important to you, then that’s wonderful. Minimalism simply allows you to
                make these decisions more consciously, more deliberately.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of successful minimalists who lead appreciably different lives. Our friend Leo Babauta
                has a wife and six children. Joshua Becker has a career he enjoys, a family he loves, and a house and a
                car in suburbia. Conversely, Colin Wright owns 51 things and travels all over the world, and Tammy
                Strobel and her husband live in a “tiny house” and are completely car-free. Even though each of these
                people are different, they all share two things in common: they are minimalists, and minimalism has
                allowed them to pursue purpose-driven lives.</p>
            <p>But how can these people be so different and yet still be minimalists? That brings us back to our
                original question: What is minimalism? If we had to sum it up in a single sentence, we would say,
                Minimalism is a tool to rid yourself of life’s excess in favor of focusing on what’s important—so you
                can find happiness, fulfillment, and freedom.</p>
            <p>Minimalism has helped us…</p>

                <li>Reclaim our time</li>

                <li>Create more, consume less</li>
                <li>Focus on our health</li>
                <li>Grow as individuals</li>
                <li>Contribute beyond ourselves</li>
                <li>Rid ourselves of excess stuff</li>
                <li>Discover purpose in our lives</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By incorporating minimalism into our lives, we’ve finally been able to find lasting happiness—and that’s
                what we’re all looking for, isn’t it? We all want to be happy. Minimalists search for happiness not
                through things, but through life itself; thus, it’s up to you to determine what is necessary and what is
                superfluous in your life.</p>
            <p>Through our essays we intend to present to you ideas of how to achieve a minimalist lifestyle without
                adhering to a strict code or an arbitrary set of rules. A word of warning, though: it isn’t easy to take
                the first steps, but your journey towards minimalism gets much easier—and more rewarding—the further you
                go. The first steps often take radical changes in your mindset, actions, and habits. Fret not, though—we
                want to help: we’ve documented our experiences so you can learn from our failures and successes,
                applying what we’ve learned to your own situation, assisting you in leading a more meaningful life.</p>
